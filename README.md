## Health Disparities in Communities Across New York City
The map shows community district-level health outcomes present in New York City. Public health agencies allocate funding and resources to areas based on the current state of the community.
Community districts are represented by community boards. These community boards provide a forum for addressing the needs of the community, making them a useful geographic unit for examining health information and turning data into action.

## How to Use
Click or hover over a neighborhood to see the number of health disparities and the average income for each community district.
